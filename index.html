            <h3>Megumi Fushiguro </h3>
            <p>Nobara and Yuji fought well together near the end of Jujutsu Kaisen's first season, and she and Yuji enjoy teasing Megumi together with their endless antics. Only true friends get along like this.</p>

            <h3>Nobara Kugisaki</h3>
            <p>Nobara treats Yuji as one of her closest friends and confidante, going so far as to mourn his “death,” even though she'd only known him for only a few days up until that point.</p>

            <h3>Satotu Gojo</h3>
            <p>Satoru and Yuji trust each other completely, and Satoru has saved Yuji's life more than once against a variety of villainous curses. His teaching methods are unconventional, but they work, and Yuji is always ready to learn</p>
